/**
 * @module Calls
 *
 * This module provides APIs for managing VoIP calls with native system integration.
 * Functions are organized into three categories:
 *
 * ## Requests (Imperative)
 * Functions that initiate actions from the app. These request the system to perform
 * an operation on behalf of the user:
 * - {@link startOutgoingCall} - Start a new outgoing call
 * - {@link answerCall} - Answer an incoming call
 * - {@link endCall} - End or decline an active call
 * - {@link setMuted} - Mute/unmute the call
 * - {@link setHeld} - Hold/unhold the call
 * - {@link playDTMF} - Play DTMF tones
 *
 * ## Reporters
 * Functions that report state changes to the system. Use these to inform the system
 * about events that occurred outside of its control (e.g., from your backend or
 * media connection):
 * - {@link reportIncomingCall} - Report a new incoming call (e.g., from push notification)
 * - {@link reportOutgoingCallConnected} - Report that an outgoing call's media is connected
 * - {@link reportCallEnded} - Report that a call ended externally (e.g., remote hangup)
 * - {@link reportVideo} - Report video state changes
 *
 * ## Fulfillers
 * Functions that complete pending system requests. When the system requests an action
 * (via event listeners), your app must perform the action and then call the corresponding
 * fulfiller to confirm completion:
 * - {@link fulfillIncomingCallConnected} - Confirm that incoming call media is connected
 * - {@link fulfillCallEnded} - Confirm that call-end cleanup/reporting is complete
 *
 * ## Typical Flow
 *
 * **Outgoing Call:**
 * 1. Call {@link startOutgoingCall} to initiate
 * 2. Listen for {@link addCallStartedListener} to know when to connect media
 * 3. Connect your media (e.g., WebRTC)
 * 4. Call {@link reportOutgoingCallConnected} when media is ready
 *
 * **Incoming Call:**
 * 1. Receive push notification with call data
 * 2. Call {@link reportIncomingCall} to show the incoming call UI
 * 3. Listen for {@link addCallAnsweredListener} to know when user answered
 * 4. Connect your media (e.g., WebRTC)
 * 5. Call {@link fulfillIncomingCallConnected} when media is ready
 *
 * **Ending a Call:**
 * - If user ends: Call {@link endCall}; when {@link addCallEndedListener} fires,
 *   clean up media and call {@link fulfillCallEnded} if the event includes a request ID
 * - If remote ends: Clean up media, then call {@link reportCallEnded}
